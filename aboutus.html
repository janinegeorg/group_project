  Who are we?
  </h1>
    <p> We are a group of three Coffee-Loving girls who have created this website to showcase some of our favourite coffee spots in london, as well as allow other coffee lovers to share their favourite spots!
    This group is made up of Janine, a recent graduate! Natasha, a risk analyst and Amira,a first-year university Student.
    This was possible through the Code-First girls scheme.
